## Systems types

![](docs/systems.jpg)

There is 3 basic type of computer systems

### Bare metal

[My notes](./docs/bare.md)

Just your own firmware written on low-level programing language.

There is [hardware abstraction layer (HAL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_abstraction#In_operating_systems) libraries for most dev boards and chips.
Where you can easily reach the board and processor peripheries.

[More on wiki.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_machine)


### RTOS

[My notes](./docs/rtos/README.md)

A real-time operating system is an operating system for real-time applications that processes data and events that have critically defined time constraints.
